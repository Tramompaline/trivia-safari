# Trivia Safri
Welcome to [Trivia Safari](https://tramompaline.github.io/trivia-safari/)!
This page is a fun multiple choice general knowledge quiz.

<u>**Design and Styling Choices for Trivia Safari:**</u>

<u>Color Scheme:</u>

Dark shades were used for the header and quiz area to easily distinguish them from the colourful background image. A warm colour tone sets the heading text apart from the dark background.

The page a features an elegant stylised text for headings and a plain text for easy readability of the quiz material.

The layout is responsive and user-friendly, designed to work seamlessly across all devices. The structure is simple and intuitive, with a clear hierarchy that guides users through the content. 

<u>Navigation:</u>

The quiz is initiated by the username entering a username and clicking the 'start quiz' button. Multiple choice questions then appear on screen. Once the user has chosen a selection the screen will display whether or not the answer is correct. The next question will display automatically after 2 seconds. After all questions have been answered the users score out of 10 will display and a button gives the user the option to restart the quiz.

<u>Imagery:</u>

A fun colourful image of wild animals evokes the spirit of a safari. A bright green tick and a bright red x serve as feedback images to the question answers.

Buttons are styled simplistically with a focus on usability.
